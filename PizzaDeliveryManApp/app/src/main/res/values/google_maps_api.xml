    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_android_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE_ANDROID&r=C7:40:FF:07:EA:C2:C9:C1:52:C8:67:CB:7B:3F:7A:81:D7:B3:80:6A%3Bcom.genius.pizzadelivery

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using this line:
    C7:40:FF:07:EA:C2:C9:C1:52:C8:67:CB:7B:3F:7A:81:D7:B3:80:6A;com.genius.pizzadelivery

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
    -->
    <string name="google_maps_key" translatable="false" templateMergeStrategy="preserve">

    </string>
